# Get data from Votronic SR Duo Digital solar chargers

I am using a Votronic SR 300 Duo Digital with serial no. 13v20.0121 which is not capable of connecting the Votronic bluetooth devices (supported starting with serial no. 14Vxx.xxxxx):

In my RV it is connected to a Votronic Solar Computer S 1250 (again not capable of the bluetooth stuff which started with serial no. 15V40.xxxxx):

So I tried connecting a logic analyzer and found some flanks with the smaller ones beeing 980Âµs apart which seemed to be a bit length. I added a UART analyzer with 1020baud (1 / 0.000980 = 1020) and now I was able to see some bytes without any timing errors:

To verify the voltage I attached a digital storage oscilloscope and found a pretty solid 5V level output (1 y-unit = 1V):
